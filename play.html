<h5>An Ideal Husband A Play</h5>
<h5>THIRD ACT. _The Library of Lord Goringâ€™s House in Curzon Street_.</h5>

    <p>[_Enter_ LORD GORING _in evening dress with a buttonhole_.  _He is
wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  _White-gloved_, _he carries a
Louis Seize cane_.  _His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion_.
_One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life_, _makes it
indeed_, _and so masters it_.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
in the history of thought_.]</p>

 <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p>Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p>

 <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <p> Yes, my lord.  <p>[_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p></p>

<h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p>

<h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>

<h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  <p> <p>[_Taking out old buttonhole_.]</p>  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>

<h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

<h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>

<h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>
<h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p> <p>[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p>  And falsehoods the truths
of other people.</p>

<h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>
